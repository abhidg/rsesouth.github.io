## Code of Conduct {.tbh3}
<p>
The RSE South 2023 workshop organisers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free workshop experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of workshop participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for the workshop.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the RSE South 2023 workshop.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the workshop at the sole discretion of the workshop organisers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.
</p>

## Further Clarification {.tbh3}
<p>
Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Excessive swearing and offensive jokes are not appropriate for the RSLondonSouthEast 2023 Workshop.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the workshop organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or removal from the workshop.
