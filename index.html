<h1>Welcome to RSE South!</h1>
<p> A new regional Research Software Engineering (RSE) network, RSE South, has been formed in early 2022 
  to bring RSE groups together to network, collaborate and to share RSE skills and resources. 
  The network aims to reach institutions located in the South of the UK, focusing on groups outside of the existing 
  London RSE network. A series of workshops, regular meetings and joint online resources are planned to grow a community 
  and foster group relationships. The network is open to and welcomes any new members passionate about software, RSEs or RSE Groups in the UK South. </p>
